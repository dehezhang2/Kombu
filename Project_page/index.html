            <h3>Motivational Image: "Police vehicle sinks in the water"</h3>

                <img src="./assets/Car-in-sea.jpg" alt="Car" width = "50%">
                <p><a href="https://polyhaven.com/gallery?render=mxJVMXgzAurhY0zoEQzr"><i>Source</i></a></p>
            </div>
            <p>The idea behinds our project proposal is to generate a similar scene as in the motivational image: a police vehicle sinks in the water. 
                We do not intend to reproduce the image exactly, but like the main idea and composition: the police vehicle appears in a place where it is not supposed to be. 
                The image shows a few interesting phenomena for rendering, e.g. different medium, fluctuating waters, glossy reflections, Fresnel effect, etc.
                Besides, we want to create some explosion on the car to show an accident scene, which utilizes light emission from volumes.
            </p>


            <h3>Features to implement:</h3>

            <p>Here is our proposed feature list we would like to implement. After the list we describe why we want
                to implement this feature and what for it is used for in the final image.</p>

            <h4>Ganlin Zhang</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>5 Points
                    <ul>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>10 Points
                    <ul>
                        <li>Emissive Participating Media</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>15 Points

                        <li>Disney BSDF</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Simple Extra Emitters (spotlight, directional light, ...)</h4>
            <p>There are four emitters except the environment. Including the headlamps and warning light.</p>
            <p>Validation: We will try to generate a valid xml-test file as it already exists for the
                point-light.</p>
                
            <h4>Anisotropic Phase Function</h4>
            <p>The Henyey-Greenstein phase function is a very popular empirical phase function. We would like to 
                implement this function for volumetric rendering. 
            </p>
            <p>Validation: We will compare the result of this phase function with the uniform phase function. Besides, we will test
                some hand-computed values or visualize the sampled directions to check the correctness. 
            </p>
                
            <h4>Images as Textures</h4>
            <p>This feature is needed for the painting of the police vehicle to make it looks more realistic.</p>
            <p>Validation: The result of this feature would be easily checked whether it is correct or not by eyes.</p>

            <h4>Basic Denoising: Bilateral Filter with Uniform Variance</h4>
            <p>The denoising step is important to reduce noisy points in the rendered images. Baisc denoising would
                appplied in our project. </p>
            <p>Validation: A simple scene would be rendered with and without the denoising technique, we will check the quality of 
                these rendered images to see whether the denoising part is implemented correctly or not. </p>

            <h4>Bump Mapping or Normal Mapping</h4>
            <p>We want to simulate the fluctuating surface of the water, thus, bump mapping is needed.</p>
            <p>Validation: The rendered scene will be visualized and be compared with the results of other reneders.</p>
            
            <h4>Simple Extra BSDF</h4>
            <p>More BSDF is needed to simulate the texture of different surface, i.e. metal, plastic, glass, etc. </p>
            <p>Validation: The rendered objects will be visualized, a plot of BSDF of certain material is also possible.</p>

            <h4>Equiangular Sampling of Single Scattering</h4>
            <p>
                The equiangular sampling of single scattering is used for the volumetric rendering pipeline.
                This method reduces the noise for volumetric rendering. The headlamps under the water have beams, which can be better rendered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Validation: We will compare the sampling result with phase function sampling to see whether the noise is reduced.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Stratified Sampling</h4>
            <p>
                Stratified sampling can be used to reduce the aliasing effect. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Validation: We will try to visualize the sampled point in the warptest GUI.
            </p>
            

            <h4>Emissive Participating Media</h4>
            <p>This feature is to simulate the explosion. We hope to generate some fire behind the sinked vehicle. Thus, emissive 
                participating media is needed.
            </p>
            <p>Validation: Use some existing open-source renderers to render a same scene and check if the results are similar.
            </p>
            

            <h4>Environment Map Emitter</h4>
            <p>This feature is to give a realistic background of our image. Also, the image we want to render does 
                not contain much light source, so that it is also used for providing enough light for this scene.
            </p>
            <p>Validation: Use some existing open-source renderers to render a same scene and check if the results are similar.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Disney BSDF</h4>
            <p>More BSDF is needed to simulate the texture of different surface, i.e. metal, plastic, glass, etc. And Disney
                BSDF technique will be applied to simulate more realistic surfaces. </p>
            <p>Validation: The rendered objects will be visualized, a plot of BSDF of certain material is also possible.</p>

            <h4>Heterogeneous Volumetric Participating Media</h4>
            <p>Since we are going to create explosion for the car, the heterogeneous volumetric rendering is required. </p>
            <p>Validation: We can render the same scene with an existing renderer (as
                Mitsuba- or Indigo-renderer for example), and compare it with our result.</p>
