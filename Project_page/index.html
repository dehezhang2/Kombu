            </div>
            <p>
                The idea of this image is to have a Christmas party on the moon. The three robots and cat on the moon images are from
                the Netfilx television series <i>Love Death + Robots </i>. The story is about long after the fall of humanity, three robots embark on a sightseeing tour of a post-apocalyptic city.
                And the cats occupies the moon as their homeland. The third image is from the Nintendo game <i>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</i>, which shows a Christmas party scene.
            </p>
            <p>The idea behinds our project proposal is to generate a similar scene as in the motivational images,
                we do not intend to reproduce the images exactly, but want to combine these scenes: Some robots and creatures are on the moon for Christmas party, and there is an earth (flooded by lava) on the background.
                We assume that the Moon will snow in the future and that ice exists. Vegetation is also present.
                We also want to create chimneys with smokes coming out.
                These scenes may show a few interesting phenomena for rendering, e.g. different matrial of surface, glossy reflections, homogeneous medium, emissive texture etc.
            </p>


            <h3>Features to implement:</h3>

            <p>Here is our proposed feature list we would like to implement. After the list we describe why we want
                to implement this feature and what for it is used for in the final image.</p>

           
            <h4>Deheng Zhang</h4>
            <p>Following features are summing up to 60 points.</p>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Ganlin Zhang</h4>
            <p>Following features are summing up to 60 points.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>5 Points
                    <ul>
                        <li>Images as Textures</li>
                        <li>Bump Mapping or Normal Mapping</li>

                        <li>Stratified Sampling</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>15 Points

                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Simple Extra Emitters: directional light</h4>
            <p>There are four emitters except the environment. Including the headlamps and warning light.</p>
            <p>Validation: We will try to generate a valid xml-test file as it already exists for the
                point-light.</p>
                
            <h4>Images as Textures</h4>
            <p>This feature is needed for the painting of the police vehicle to make it looks more realistic.</p>
            <p>Validation: The result of this feature would be easily checked whether it is correct or not by eyes.</p>

            <h4>Basic Denoising: Bilateral Filter with Uniform Variance</h4>
            <p>The denoising step is important to reduce noisy points in the rendered images. Baisc denoising would
                appplied in our project. </p>
            <p>Validation: A simple scene would be rendered with and without the denoising technique, we will check the quality of 
                these rendered images to see whether the denoising part is implemented correctly or not. </p>

            <h4>Bump Mapping or Normal Mapping</h4>
            <p>We want to simulate the fluctuating surface of the water, thus, bump mapping is needed.</p>
            <p>Validation: The rendered scene will be visualized and be compared with the results of other reneders.</p>
            
            <h4>Simple Extra BSDF: Conductor</h4>
            <p>More BSDF is needed to simulate the texture of different surface like metal</p>
            <p>Validation: The rendered objects will be visualized, a plot of BSDF of certain material is also possible.</p>

            <h4>Simple Extra BSDF: Blend BSDF</h4>
            <p>Blend BSDF will be used to mix multiple BSDF to better simulate object with complicated surface. i.e. surface of the Earth. </p>
            <p>Validation: The rendered scene will be visualized and be compared with the results of other reneders.</p>

            <h4>Anisotropic Phase Function</h4>
            <p>The Henyey-Greenstein phase function is a very popular empirical phase function. We would like to 
                implement this function for volumetric rendering. 
            </p>
            <p>Validation: We will compare the result of this phase function with the uniform phase function. Besides, we will test
                some hand-computed values or visualize the sampled directions to check the correctness. 
            </p>
            <h4>Object Instancing</h4>
            <p>Since we use one model multiple times (e.g. the Christmas gifts), and shape groups (the Christmas pine with candies on it), we 
                need to instantiate the object.
            </p>
            <p>
                Validation: we will directly check whether the object is reused in the scene. 
            </p>



            <!-- <h4>Equiangular Sampling of Single Scattering</h4>
            <p>
                The equiangular sampling of single scattering is used for the volumetric rendering pipeline.
                This method reduces the noise for volumetric rendering.
            </p> -->
            <h4>Different distance sampling and transmittance estimation methods</h4>
            <p>
                The different distance sampling is used for the volumetric rendering pipeline.
            </p>
            <p>
                Validation: We will compare the sampling result with other render such as mitsuba.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Stratified Sampling</h4>
            <p>
                Stratified sampling can be used to reduce the aliasing effect. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Validation: We will try to visualize the sampled point in the warptest GUI.
            </p>
            

            <h4>Environment Map Emitter</h4>
            <p>This feature is to give a realistic background of our image. Also, the image we want to render does 
                not contain much light source, so that it is also used for providing enough light for this scene.
            </p>
            <p>Validation: Use some existing open-source renderers to render a same scene and check if the results are similar.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Disney BSDF (5 params: roughness, specular, metallic, sheen, sheen_tint)</h4>
            <p>More BSDF is needed to simulate the texture of different surface, i.e. metal, plastic, glass, etc. And Disney
                BSDF technique will be applied to simulate more realistic surfaces. </p>
            <p>Validation: The rendered objects will be visualized, a plot of BSDF of certain material is also possible.</p>
            
            <h4>Heterogeneous Participating Media</h4>
            <p>Since we are going to create the smoke on the house, the heterogeneous volumetric rendering is required.</p>
            <p>Validation: We can render the same scene with an existing renderer (as Mitsuba- or Indigo-renderer for example), and compare it with our result.</p>

            <!-- <h4>Layered BSDF</h4>
            <p>Multi-layers BSDF is needed to simulate object with complicated, i.e. Earth. And Layered
                BSDF will be applied to simulate more realistic atmosphere of the Earth. </p>
            <p>Validation: The rendered objects will be visualized, we will compare the difference with the ones without layered BRDF.</p> -->
